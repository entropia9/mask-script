# mask-script

A script for photoshop. I made it to speed up things at work. 
  1. Asks user to select folder.
  2. Gets pictures .psd files (ending with _Rend.psd) and mask files (ending with _Mask.psd). Both files should have same base name. 
  3. For each file-mask pair, script creates mask in file and copies mask file contents. 
  4. Lastly, it saves result as .png
